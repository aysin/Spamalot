What is Python, why learn Python?

Comparing Python to other programming languages:

The goal of this committee is to motivate BnB members who have some programming experience 
to learn a new programing language: Python 3. We'll try to learn as much as we can with the time we have.
We'll start with if statements, loops, arrays "lists" then functions and so on.

we'll meet weekly? outside of school for about an hour to work on Python projects or practice the things we learned.

if you have zero programming experience, start here: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python 

if you are currently taking/took CS-110 or higher, or familiar with another programming language, procceed to step1: 

step1: Download the current stable version of Python 3 (Python 3.2.3) for your operating system.
Python 2 won't work for what we're doing this semester! https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download

Python 3 comes bundled with IDLE "IDLE is the Python IDE built with the Tkinter GUI toolkit."
more info: https://wiki.python.org/moin/IDLE

you are free to use a different IDE. I like IDLE because its very lightweight and corss-platform, plus it's coded in Python ;)

step2: create a Github account: at github.com, follow me github.com/abealtaweel

step3: learn the basics of Git 

option1:
http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1 

option2:
http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

Git cheat sheet: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf

step4: try to write a hello world program in Python 3. 

step5: try to upload it to our Python repository github.com/abealtaweel/Spamalot (note: i have to list you as a Collaborator, so you can push files to the repo.)

contact me if you get stuck or if you have any questions

Hint: in python 3 print is a BIF "builtin function" 
print("It's just a flesh wound!")
