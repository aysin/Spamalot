if you have zero programming experience, start here: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python 

if you are currently taking/took CS-110 or higher, or familar with another programming language, procceed to step1: 

Step1: Download the current stable version of Python 3 (Python 3.2.3) for your operating system. Python 2 won't work for what we're doing this semester! https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download

Python 3 comes bundled with IDLE "IDLE is the Python IDE built with the Tkinter GUI toolkit."
more info: https://wiki.python.org/moin/IDLE

you are free to use a different IDE. I like IDLE because its very lightweight and corss-platform, plus it's coded in Python ;)

step2: create a Github account: at github.com, follow me github.com/abealtaweel

step3: (15minutes): learn the basics of Git http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1 

step4: try to write a hello world program in Python 3. 

step5: try to upload it to our Python repository github.com/abealtaweel/Spamalot

contact me if you get stuck or if you have any questions

we'll meet once a week to work on Python projects to practice the things we learned.

Hint: in python 3 print is a BIF "built in function" 
print("It's just a flesh wound!")
